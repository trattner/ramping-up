    This Google Doodle has a cool magnifying glass effect:
    https://www.google.com/logos/2011/worldsfair.html

    Your task is to implement a similar effect! When the user's mouse moves over the logo, show the magnifying glass with the "magnified" portion of the logo inside. (Don't worry about adding fancy enter/leave transitions and animations.)

    The only images you'll need are already in the "img" folder
